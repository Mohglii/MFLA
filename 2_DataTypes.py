"""

# Dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its corresponding value.

# List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing while Dictionary elements are accessed via keys

# Define a dictionary using key-value pairs

# View the dictionary

# Check the data type

# Access specific element in the dictionary using a specific key (ex: Key2)

# Define a dictionary for a bank client listing all his/her assets!

# Access elements in the dictionary

# Add a new item to an existing dictionary

# The output from split is a list
